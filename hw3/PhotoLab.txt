Lab 3 was very similar to Lab 2. But the Makefile did give me trouble, and
I had to spend a lot of time thinking about the dependies of each
target and that helped me flesh out how to write this program. I looked the power
point of the lecture again and again. Because before I figured out how to make 
a correct Makefile, when I ran my Makefile, it showed a lot of error.

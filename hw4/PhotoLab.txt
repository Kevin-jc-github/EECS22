This assignment4 is a more advanced project based on assignment3. 
This lab tested our ability to work with dynamic image sizes and our ability to work with pointers. 
I had to use malloc and free allocate space in memory to keep track of the pixel's data. 
Converting our previous DIPs to this new form was definitely a challenge and requires
a lot of caution because one change can break the whole code.

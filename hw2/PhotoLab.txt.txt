This PhotoLab project allows the users to upload images and apply various filters
to them. When approaching each funciton,like vflip, boarder , and so on. I used for loops to process the 2d
arrays of pixels and used logical and mathimatical reasoning to transform the
pixels to the desired filter. I used nested loops to process 2d matrices because
it is efficient and clear.
